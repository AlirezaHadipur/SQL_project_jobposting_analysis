You can see the queries here: [Click](Queries)üîç.
# Background üî¶
I attended a [SQL Toturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA&t=12914s)
on YouTube from Luke Barousse as a part of my journey as a data analyst. My goal was to improve my knowledge about SQL and whatever I learned In university about SQL as a computer engineer.

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
- What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
- What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
- What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
- What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I Used üõ†‚öí
Throughout this project, I used different tools to work easier and more efficiently:

**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

**PostgreSQL :** The chosen database management system(DBMS), it's free and powerful.

**Visual Studio Code:** My code editor, I connected VSCode to PostgreSQL by extensions.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

**ChatGPT:** Getting useful insights from the result of queries and visualizing.

**Microsoft Copilot:** Getting useful insights from the result of queries and visualizing.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the different roles job market(especially data analysis). Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the top 10 highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field.

```SQL
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_work_from_home,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id 
    
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Key insights:**

    1. Salary Ranges:
    The average annual salaries for these data analyst roles vary significantly:
    Data Analyst: Around $650,0001.
    Director of Analytics: Approximately $336,5002.
    Associate Director-Data Insights: An average of $255,829.53.

    2. Work Flexibility:
    All the listed positions offer full-time employment.
    Notably, they also allow remote work (with the ‚Äújob_work_from_home‚Äù attribute set to true).
    This trend reflects the growing acceptance of remote work arrangements, providing data analysts with flexibility and work-life balance.

    3. Job Postings Timeline:
    The posting dates for these roles span across different months in 2023:
    Data Analyst: Posted on February 20, 20231.
    Director of Analytics: Posted on August 23, 20232.
    Associate Director-Data Insights: Posted on June 18, 20233.
    Analyzing the timing of job postings can reveal seasonal trends or industry-specific hiring cycles.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```SQL
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT job_id,
        job_title,
        company_dim.name AS company_name,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date
    FROM job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON 
        job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
job_to_skill AS(
    SELECT job_id,
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills,
        type AS job_type
    FROM skills_job_dim
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON 
        skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
)
SELECT top_paying_jobs.*, skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN job_to_skill ON 
    top_paying_jobs.job_id = job_to_skill.job_id
```
**Key insights:**

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.
